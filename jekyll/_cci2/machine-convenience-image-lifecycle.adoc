[#overview]
== Overview

CircleCI prioritizes support for the most recent stable releases of Linux VM, Android, Windows, Remote Docker, macOS, and CUDA virtual machine images. When a new major version of an image is available, CircleCI will begin the deprecation process of the oldest version supported.

== Image Deprecation Process

CircleCI machine image deprecations are announced via link:https://circleci.com/changelog/[changelog], email, and link:https://discuss.circleci.com/c/announcements/39[Discuss] post. Announcements include the list of affected images, scheduled brownout dates and durations, and end of life date. Scheduled brownout dates will also be listed on the CircleCI link:https://status.circleci.com/[status page].

== Image Brownouts
A CircleCI machine image brownout is a temporary, planned period during which deprecated virtual machine images are intentionally made unavailable on the CircleCI platform. During a brownout, CI/CD jobs that attempt to use deprecated images will fail, giving users advance notice of upcoming permanent image removals

Machine image brownouts serve several critical functions in CircleCI's image lifecycle management:

1. **Warning Mechanism**: They act as a highly visible alert that certain images are approaching end-of-life (EOL).
2. **Dependency Discovery**: They help teams identify hidden dependencies on deprecated images, particularly through orbs or inherited configurations.
3. **Preventing Major Service Disruption**: A short, planned brownout allows teams to update configurations before permanent image removal would cause extended workflow failures.

During a brownout, jobs that use deprecated images will fail with the message "This job was rejected because the resource class is unavailable".

If you need to get your workflows running during an active brownout, update your .circleci/config.yml file to use a supported image:

[,yaml]
----
# Change this:
machine:
image: ubuntu-2004:202201-01  # Deprecated image

# To this:
machine:
  image: ubuntu-2004:current    # or "default" for the latest supported version
----

**For Remote Docker**: Update the version parameter:

[,yaml]
----
- setup_remote_docker:
    version: docker24           # Use a supported version
----

=== Tips to minimize brownout impact

1. **Use Dynamic Image References**: Instead of pinning to specific dated versions, use the following tags:
** `default`: Always points to the recommended stable version
** `current`: Points to the latest stable version
** `edge`: Points to the newest release (may include experimental features)
2. **Regularly Update Orbs**: If you use CircleCI orbs, ensure they're updated to current versions, as outdated orbs may specify deprecated images internally.
3. **Check Hidden Dependencies**: Inspect all workflows, including those triggered by external events or scheduled runs.
4. **Subscribe to Deprecation Notices**: Follow the CircleCI Discuss forum's link:https://discuss.circleci.com/c/announcements/39[Announcements] category for announcements.
5. **Use the Image Updater Tool**: CircleCI provides a tool at https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/image-updater to help identify and update deprecated images.

[#brownout-faq]
== FAQ About CircleCI Brownouts
**Q: How long do brownouts typically last?**

A: Most brownouts last from 10 minutes to 24 hours, depending on the image type and its usage across the platform.

**Q: Will CircleCI notify me before a brownout occurs?**

A: Yes, CircleCI sends email notifications to organizations whose projects use deprecated images and posts announcements on their Discuss forum.

**Q: What happens if I don't update my images before the EOL date?**

A: After the EOL date, deprecated images will be permanently removed, and any jobs attempting to use them will fail until configurations are updated.

**Q: How can I test my workflows with new images before a brownout?**

A: Create a branch with updated configuration files, then push and test this branch before merging changes to your main branch.

**Q: Are there any costs associated with updating to newer images?**

A: There's no additional cost for using newer CircleCI images, though you should test thoroughly as newer images may have updated software versions that could affect your workflows.
